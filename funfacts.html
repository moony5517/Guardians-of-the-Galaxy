            <h3>September 1859</h3>
            <p>
                Aurora was bright enough to read by, seen extremely far south (Cuba). Telegraph systems ran without
                being
                powered. Some caught on far and operators were electrocuted. Considered to be the largest solar storm on
                record (estimates for an event of this magnitude today are up to $2 trillion).

            <h3>March 1989</h3>
            <p>
                A huge magnetic storm caused the Quebec power grid to fail in 90 seconds leaving millions without power
                for up to 9 hours (total cost not just to the Quebec power grid estimated at over $2 billion).

            <h3>October/November 2003</h3>
            <p>
                Major loss of GPS accuracy with errors over 50 meters, transformer failures in South Africa, major HF
                radio blackouts, 30 satellite anomalies including one satellite loss (many billions of $s).

                Just this month, CACTus (software package to detect CME in image sequences from LASCO telescope)
                detected by SECCHI-A satellite ones of the highest velocity CME on13th of September at 11:53, maxV is
                equal to 1785 and minV is equal to 0694 both measured in km/s.

                Although our Sun is the biggest object in our solar system and is the closest star to earth (only 93
                million miles away from our dear planet) The sun is an average star, its size, age, and temperature fall
                in about the middle of the ranges of these properties for all stars.

                On July 23, 2012, a massive cloud of solar material erupted off the sun’s right side, zooming out into
                space. It soon passed one of NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, spacecraft,
                which clocked the CME as traveling between 1,800 and 2,200 miles per second as it left the sun. This was
                the fastest CME ever observed by STEREO.

                This year the sun emitted a strong flare on 17th of June, exactly at 5:49 p.m. ET, this flare is
                classified as an X1.2 flare. X-class denotes the most intense flares, while the number provides more
                information about its strength. This picture was captured during the flare by NASA’s Solar Dynamics
                Observatory, the image shows a subset of extreme ultraviolet light that highlights the extremely hot
                material in flares and which is colorized in teal.
